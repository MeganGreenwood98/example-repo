## Installation

To run this script locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeganGreenwood98/example-repo.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
  cd example-repo
3. Run the script using Python:
  python email_task.py

## Usage

After running the script, you will see printed output showing the behaviour of email objects — such as marking them as read or checking details. This is useful for understanding how class definitions work in practice.
Here’s an example of the expected output:
Would you like to:
    1. Read an email
    2. View unread emails
    3. Quit application

Enter selection: 1
0      Hello
1      Decision
2      Food
Enter which email you would like to read: 0
Email Address: megan.g@hotmail.co.uk
Subject Line: Hello
Email Content: How are you?

Email from megan.g@hotmail.co.uk marked as read.
